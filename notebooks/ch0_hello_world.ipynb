    "# Understanding ChatGoogleGenerativeAI Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an AI chatbot using Google's Gemini model, we need to configure it with several parameters. Let's understand each one in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Core Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\"`\n",
    "**What it is:** The specific AI model we want to use  \n",
    "**Simple explanation:** Think of this like choosing which \"brain\" the AI should use. Different models have different capabilities and speeds.\n",
    "- `gemini-2.0-flash` is a fast and efficient model from Google\n",
    "- Other options: `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Just like you might choose between a calculator or a computer for math - both work, but have different speeds and capabilities!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `temperature=0`\n",
    "**What it is:** Controls how creative or random the AI's responses are  \n",
    "**Range:** 0.0 to 2.0  \n",
    "**Simple explanation:** \n",
    "- **`temperature=0`** → Very predictable, same answer every time (like a calculator)\n",
    "- **`temperature=1`** → Balanced, some creativity\n",
    "- **`temperature=2`** → Very creative, different answers each time (like a creative writer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# temperature=0: \"Hello! How can I help you?\"\n",
    "# temperature=1: \"Hello there! How may I assist you today?\"\n",
    "# temperature=2: \"Greetings! What exciting question can I help you explore?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use what:**\n",
    "- Use **0** for factual answers (math, science, coding)\n",
    "- Use **0.7-1.0** for creative writing, brainstorming\n",
    "- Use **1.5-2.0** for maximum creativity (stories, poems)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `max_tokens=None`\n",
    "**What it is:** Maximum number of words/pieces the AI can generate  \n",
    "**Simple explanation:** This limits how long the AI's response can be.\n",
    "- `None` = No limit (AI decides based on the question)\n",
    "- `100` = Short response (~75 words)\n",
    "- `1000` = Long response (~750 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- Prevents extremely long responses\n",
    "- Saves API costs (you pay per token)\n",
    "- Controls response length\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world analogy:** Like telling someone \"explain in 100 words or less\" vs \"explain in detail\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `timeout=None`\n",
    "**What it is:** How long to wait for the AI to respond (in seconds)  \n",
    "**Simple explanation:** If the AI takes too long, stop waiting and show an error.\n",
    "- `None` = Wait forever (not recommended for production)\n",
    "- `30` = Wait maximum 30 seconds\n",
    "- `60` = Wait maximum 1 minute\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenario:** If your internet is slow or the AI service is busy, this prevents your program from hanging forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `max_retries=2`\n",
    "**What it is:** How many times to try again if something fails  \n",
    "**Simple explanation:** If the request fails (network error, server busy), automatically try again.\n",
    "- `0` = Don't retry, fail immediately\n",
    "- `2` = Try 2 more times before giving up (total 3 attempts)\n",
    "- `5` = Try 5 more times (total 6 attempts)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1st attempt: ❌ Server busy\n",
    "2nd attempt: ❌ Network timeout\n",
    "3rd attempt: ✅ Success!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's useful:** Makes your code more reliable by handling temporary network issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `api_key=google_api_key`\n",
    "**What it is:** Your personal password to access Google's AI service  \n",
    "**Simple explanation:** Like a key to unlock the AI service - proves you have permission to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes:**\n",
    "- 🔒 Keep this SECRET! Never share it publicly\n",
    "- 💰 Tracks your usage for billing\n",
    "- 🎫 Get it from: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security tip:** In real projects, store this in environment variables, not directly in code!\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🎯 Best Practices for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple:** Use default values (`temperature=0`, `max_retries=2`)\n",
    "2. **Experiment:** Try different temperatures to see how responses change\n",
    "3. **Set limits:** Use `max_tokens` to control costs when learning\n",
    "4. **Be secure:** Never commit API keys to GitHub or share them\n",
    "5. **Handle errors:** Use `max_retries` to make your code more robust\n"

    "response = llm.invoke(\"Your question here\")\n",
    "print(f\"Cost estimate: {response.usage_metadata['total_tokens']} tokens\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Optimize for Cost**\n",
    "- Use shorter, clearer prompts (reduces input tokens)\n",
    "- Set `max_tokens` to limit output length\n",
    "- Use `temperature=0` for consistent, often shorter responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Watch for Token Limits**\n",
    "- If your prompt + response > model limit, you'll get an error\n",
    "- Example: 8K token limit means `input_tokens + output_tokens ≤ 8,000`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Free Tier Management**\n",
    "Most AI services give free tokens per month:\n",
    "- Google Gemini: Often 50-100 requests/day free\n",
    "- Track your daily usage to stay within limits\n",
